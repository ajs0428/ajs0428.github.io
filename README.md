### PhD Candidate at the University of Washington

I'm interested in characterizing carbon storage and cycling across the terrestrial to aquatic hydrologic gradient using field collected measurments coupled with data driven analysis such as remote sensing and machine learning. 

However, I'm always learning new things in research and I'm very open to discussing and collaborating.

2025 Cornell Atkinson Postdoctoral Fellow

I'm interested in characterizing carbon storage and cycling across the terrestrial to aquatic hydrologic gradient using field collected measurements coupled with data driven analysis such as remote sensing and machine learning.

My current research focuses on uncovering the natural climate solution potential of inland wetlands in New York State.

I'm always learning new things and open to discussing and collaborating.

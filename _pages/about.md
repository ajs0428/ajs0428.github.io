### 2025 Cornell Atkinson Postdoctoral Fellow

I am an environmental and data scientist interested in characterizing and quantifying carbon storage and cycling across terrestrial and aquatic environments using field collected measurements coupled with data driven analysis such as remote sensing and machine learning. This spans fields such as wetland ecology, forest ecology, soil science, hydrology, and data science.

My current research focuses on uncovering the natural climate solution potential of inland wetlands in New York State, working with faculty mentor Meredith Holgerson and external adviser Samantha Yeo (The Nature Conservancy).

I am a passionate educator and have experience teaching undergraduate ecology, soil science, and lidar remote sensing.

I greatly appreciate opportunities to continue learning new things in research through collaborating and sharing ideas.

Please feel free to get in touch with me using my email: ajs544@cornell.edu

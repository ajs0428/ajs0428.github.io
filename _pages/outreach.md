<h2 style="text-align: center;">Outreach and Service</h2>

The path to being a scientist is not straightforward for everyone. I love the opportunity to reach out to others who have not had the opportunities to interact with science or scientists before. I find inspiration in working with younger people and students to give them some insight into science through my personal experience.   
  
### Upward Bound

I had an amazing opportunity to work with the Upward Bound program through the Univeristy of Maine, with Scott Braddock and Seth Campbell. I was able to work with other scientists, Diogo Spinola and Raquel Portes to facilitate a fieldwork experience in Juneau, Alaska for high school students from around the U.S who are underrepresented in the geosciences and would be first generation college students.

### Central High School, Independence, OR
During the virtual days of the pandemic I was able to provide a guest presentation about my PhD work and talk about college and graduate school for a local PNW high school

### Seacoast Science Center

Back on the east coast during my Masters, I had the wonderful opportunity to organize field trips to the Odiorne Point State Park for younger students. These covered exploration of the intertidal ecosystem.

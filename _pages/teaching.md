Teaching is a profoundly fulfilling and rewarding experience. As an educator, witnessing students' growth and development is a privilege that brings great joy and is an opportunity to impart knowledge, inspire curiosity, and foster a love for learning. I especially enjoy engaging with diverse students, encouraging open dialogue, and tailoring teaching methods to individual learning styles to create a dynamic and vibrant learning environment. 

Below are brief descriptions of teaching experiences at the undergraduate level

### Sustaining Pacific Northwest Ecosystems ESRM 201 Autumn 2022

#### Course Objectives 

This course provided an introduction to the principles of ecology, focusing on the ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. It aimed to establish a solid foundation in ecological principles for future upper-division SEFS courses. Throughout the course, students practiced observation and description skills, learned to interpret scientific literature, and collaborated on group projects to improve communication skills. 

I primarily taught the introduction to soils module focusing on soil formation and ecosystem services

Welcome to my blog! This is where I'll share updates on my research, thoughts on wetland carbon cycling, soil science, remote sensing, and other topics related to my work as a postdoctoral fellow at Cornell University.

## What to Expect

In future posts, I plan to cover:

- Research updates and findings from my current projects
- Insights from fieldwork and data collection
- Reflections on wetland ecology and carbon dynamics
- Tutorials and methods for remote sensing analysis

Stay tuned for more content!
